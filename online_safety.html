              Marci’s used computers before but this is the first one she’s
              owned herself. She has a few worries about keeping her computer
              safe. Lots of people worry about this. As long as Marci installs
              anti-virus software and keeps it up to date she’ll be fine.

              A good anti-virus program will protect your computer from
              different types of threats, known as malware. This includes
              trojans, spyware as well as viruses. Trojans are programs that
              pretend to be genuine but aren't. Spyware are programs that steal
              information. You don't have to spend a lot of money. Free programs
              provide good protection.

            <p class="slide-text">
              Installing anti-virus software is much easier than it might sound.
              You can buy or download an all-in-one security package. When you
              open the program, it will have on screen instructions about how to
              install it and how to keep it up to date.
